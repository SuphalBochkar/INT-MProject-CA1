# Fibonacci Checker
    # In this project user will enter single or multiple numbers 
    # and your system will predict that the entered number or number’s is/are valid number(s) in a Fibonacci series or not.
    # For example, if user inputs 2 numbers
    # 0 and 7
    # 0 is valid and 7 is invalid.
    # Because if we plot Fibonacci series 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13……, In this series 0 is their but 7 is not present.
    # Constraint: range of the single number or multiple numbers you are entering can be huge.
