# Generate Stories 
    # The task is to generate a random story every time user runs the program.
    # Every time the user runs the program, we must produce a random tale. 
    # We'll first store the portions of the tales in distinct lists, and 
    # then use the Random module to choose random sections of the stories from those lists:
    # To construct a random narrative, we first imported the random module, 
    # then built sections of the stories in separate lists, then randomly picked portions of the lists.
    # Note: You store the portion of your tale/story in different lists, 
    # and during displaying the story when you pick the portions randomly your complete story must make some sense.
    # Hint:Random module can be used to select random parts of the story stored in different lists.
    # Sections of the story can be an adjective, a preposition, a proper noun, etc.
