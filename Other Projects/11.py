# Define A Number
    # In this project you have to enter a range [A, B] 
    # and system will randomly pick any number from your given range and check the status of that given number.
    # The properties to be checked are:
    # Is that number is odd or even
    # Is that number is positive or negative number
    # Is that number is prime number or composite number.
    # After checking the status, you have to display all the properties followed by the randomly picked number.
    # For example
    # Range is (1,12) and randomly picked number is 10
    # Then the properties followed by this number are:
    # 10 is a positive number
    # 10 is an even number
    # 10 is a composite number
