# Nature of number in random range
    # n this project you have to enter a positive integer range [A, B] and 
    # system will find out the status (Prime or composite) of each number available in the given range.
    # At the end print the count also.
    # Note: Make use of efficient approach to check prime status of the number.
    # For example: Range is (7,10)
    # Then the status of each number in the range is:
    # 7 is prime 8 is composite or not prime 9 is composite 10 is composite
    # Count: 1 prime and 3 composite numbers in the range.
