# No Days Till Now
    # Design an application where user will input two dates.
    # His/her date of birth in DD/MM/YY format.
    # Current (Present day) date in DD/MM/YY format.
    # Your app will calculate and let the user know how many days that person survived in this world.
    # Note: Your calculation must be accurate and you have to consider leap and non-leap years separately.
